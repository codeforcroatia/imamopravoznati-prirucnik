problem: Develop an Open Data Publication Plan
---

## The problem
Due to various constraints of public sector bodies, not all potential public sector information may be made available at one time. Therefore these organisations should develop an Open Data publication plan that balances the requirements and needs of all stakeholders, both internal and external, with the available resources as well as the potential benefits and risks associated with the publication of the identified datasets.

## The solution
_How to open data_, [Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/how-to-open-up-data/): This section outlines how to put together an Open Data release roadmap, which is one of the key aspects of this Share PSI best practice.

_How to make data public_, [Open Data Policy Guidelines](http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/), [Sunlight Foundation](sunlightfoundation.com): This resource gives specific instructions on how to develop an open data publication plan.

[_Open Knowledge Network_](okfn.org/network): Public sector should consider utilizing some sort of public comment/feedback mechanism that leverages the Open Knowledge Network and civil society more broadly. Github presents a potential platform for this.

_How to plan and budget an open data initiative_, [The Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org/guides/how-to-plan-and-budget-an-open-data-initiative): This guide, developed by [The Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/), helps governments plan the costs and data prioritization to guide an open data publication plan.

[_Open Data Readiness Assessment_](http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org/en/odra.html): This tool, developed by the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/), helps identify current government state to determine where they can go in terms of open data.
