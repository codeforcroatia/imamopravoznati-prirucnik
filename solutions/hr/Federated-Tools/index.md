## The problem
The number of datasets and dataset owners is large and may cross various levels of government, making it difficult to implement a central solution where all owners unify their data in one system. However, federated/distributed tools for open data collection enable the automatic publication of metadata for each dataset which allow for the creation of a complete index of reusable public information. Users can then access this portal to find the website of the public entity holding the data in which they are interested in.

## The solution
[_CKAN Federated Feature_](http://ckan.org/features/#federate): CKAN has a federate feature and is a useful resource for governments creating an open data portal.

_How to open data_, [Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/how-to-open-up-data/): This resource outlines different methods for publishing open data online, including establishing a portal or using an existing portal.

_Open Data Portal Requirements_, [Center for Government Excellence](http://govex.jhu.edu/open-data-portal-requirements/): This guide, developed by the [Center for Government Excellence](http://govex.jhu.edu/) at John Hopkins University, contains a set of sample requirements to help governments evaluate, develop (or procure), deploy, and launch an open data portal.
