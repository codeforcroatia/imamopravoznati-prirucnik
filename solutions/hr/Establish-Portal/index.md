## The problem
Data portals can facilitate the distribution of open data by providing easy-to-access, searchable hub for multiple datasets. They often also act as showcases for reuse of data and as a hub for the interested community. Data portal software can be developed from scratch, bought off the shelf or obtained as open source software.

## The solution
[_CKAN_](ckan.org): This Share PSI best practice calls for a platform for publishing open data and the use of the open source package. CKAN, is explicitly mentioned as a tool to help implement this best practice. Additionally, CKAN has an active developer community with which public officials can involve with implementation.

_How to open data_, [Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/how-to-open-up-data/): The Open Data Handbook, developed by Open Knowledge International, outlines different methods for publishing open data online, including establishing a portal or using an existing portal.

_Open Data Portal Requirements_, [Center for Government Excellence](http://govex.jhu.edu/open-data-portal-requirements/): This guide, developed by the [Center for Government Excellence](http://govex.jhu.edu/) at John Hopkins University, contains a set of sample requirements to help governments evaluate, develop (or procure), deploy, and launch an open data portal.
