## The problem
In order to unlock the maximum commercial and non-commercial potential of public sector information, organisations should strive to publish as much data for re-use as possible at no charge. As a result, commercial products and services developed will have lower cost, increasing their viability and lowering the barrier for their access to the public. At the same time, zero charges facilitate non-commercial re-uses that otherwise would not have been possible.

## The solution
_How to open up data_, [Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/how-to-open-up-data/): This resource argues that if the cost of collecting and maintaining a dataset is already being absorbed by the private sector, the additional cost of sending the data to a third-party is aproximately nothing. Therefore re-users should be charged nothing.
