problem: Publish Statistical Data In Linked Data Format
---

## The problem
Statistical data may be published in a range of formats and standards that do not allow linking across datasets. However, this data is often the foundations for policy prediction, planning and adjustments, and therefore has a significant impact on the society. The process of collecting and monitoring socio-economic indicators can be considerably improved if the data produced by government organizations are published in Linked Data Format.

## The solution
_National Statistics_, [Global Open Data Index](http://index.okfn.org/dataset/statistics/): National Statistics is included as one of the datasets assessed in the [Global Open Data Index](index.okfn.org) and therefore represents the demand for this data to be open and interoperable.
