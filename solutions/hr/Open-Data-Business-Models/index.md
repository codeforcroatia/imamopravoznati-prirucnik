## The problem
Open data holds considerable economic and social value beyond the walls of the governments and institutions that share their data. However, there are still many open data-driven organisations that are struggling to comprehend how to generate revenue and survive by adapting to the changes brought on by the ubiquitous growth of open data and 'Big Data.' Therefore, data-driven organisations should develop and implement a business model before starting their business.
