title: Adding a resource to the library
lang: en
---

<p class="lead">Our resource library is a curated collection of open data reosurces across the community. Everyone can add a resource to the library. This is how to do so.</p>

## 1. Add a folder

Log in to GitHub and head to this [link](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/{{ site.github_repo }}/tree/gh-pages/resources).

Every resource has a slug number. To add your resource, you need to give it a number. Look at the list and give your resource the number that follows the current last number in the list (e.g. if the number is 056, your resource should be named 057).

Click on the plus symbol <code class="icon-plus"><span>[plus icon]</span></code> in the directory line and add the number and a slash ('/'). For example: `060/`.

## 2. Add an index file

Click on the plus symbol <code class="icon-plus"><span>[plus icon]</span></code> again. Add a file named 'index.md' to your new folder.

## 3. Add the resource

In the text editor, add the front matter fields in this pattern:
