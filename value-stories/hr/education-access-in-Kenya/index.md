Visualising education data in Kenya revealed a dynamic picture of the state of schools, as well as future opportunities for improvement. In a country where 50% of the population is under 18, it is important for policy-makers to have access to accurate information about access to education, literacy rates and performance across regions. A joint operation between [GroundTruth Initiative](http://groundtruth.in/2014/07/09/), Map Kibera, Development Gateway, Feedback Labs, and the Gates Foundation, among others, has connected existing data to bring the informal school sector in Kenya to light for parents, school leaders and education officials.22 With open data visualisations, it is now possible to see where schools are located in Kenya, and the percentage of children not in education, revealing areas of the population which may be under-served and can therefore be targeted with better services.
